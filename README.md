# Study_Chinese

Study Chinese is an app for studying Chinese. 
It teaches the language in a logical sequence of sentences, each of which recycles previously taught vocabulary. 
It will eventually include the 5000 most commonly used words in Chinese. This app is best for those who already know pinyin.
